Now that we have an understanding of how a web page is structured (HTML) and how it's styled (CSS), let's take a look at how we can add interactivity and dynamic content with JavaScript.

# The Basics

Let's start with a couple concepts that are common across most programming languages

## Declaring and Assigning Variables

Back in the day, we had one keyword used to declare our variables, `var`. Relatively new in JavaScript (2015) are better alternatives: `const` and `let`.

While the `var` keyword doesn't go away in JavaScript, it's not used in any of the applications we'll be building as `const` and `let` will be used as better alternatives.

### const vs let

`let` behaves very much like `var` however it's more predictable. Let's look at a quick code snippet to get a better idea.

```js
var firstName = 'Michael'

if (name === 'Michael') {
  // üëÜüèΩNote that "var lastName..." is being declared inside of these curly braces

  var lastName = 'Liendo'
}

console.log(lastName) // "Liendo" ü§î
```

However, the `let` (and `const`) keyword respects braces as being a sort of bounding block:

```js
var firstName = 'Michael'

if (name === 'Michael') {
  let lastName = 'Liendo'
}

console.log(lastName) // üö® Error: lastName is not defined
```

`const` short for constant, can be a bit misleading when first learing. What we really mean is that what is declared as `const` can't be reassigned, not so much that it can't be changed.

Let's look at some examples.

> üóíÔ∏è In the code above and below note that I snuck in something new: the `console.log()` _function_. We'll go into the details later, but for now, know that it let's us display content in our browser's console, as opposed to on our webpage.

https://codesandbox.io/s/const-and-let-examples-nqvf6

The rule of thumb, and the convention that we'll be using in this course: Define all variables as `const` and if you need to update their value, then change it to `let`.

## JavaScript Types

In the above examples, I casually introduced you to three of JavaScript's types: `string`, `number`, and `boolean`. These are known as _primitive types_.

### Understanding Primitive Types in JavaScript

The main thing to know about primitive types--commonly referred to as "basic types", is that they're passed to _value_.

To get a better understanding of what I mean, let's look at an example:

```js
let food = 'tacos'

const myFavoriteFood = food // myFavoriteFood now equals "taco"

food = 'Hamburgers'
console.log(myFavoriteFood) // What is the value?? üßê
```

<details>
  <summary><b>Click here for the answer, and explanation</b></summary>
  <p>tacos</p>
  <p>Because <i>strings</i> , <i>booleans</i>, and <i>numbers</i> don't take a lot of memory to create, a copy of the the value is made, as opposed to a direct link.</p>
</details>
<br/>

Now that we understand how primitive types are created, updated, and copied from one variable to another, let's hold off on learning about _composite types_ for the time being, and take a quick detour to learn about conditionals and equality in JavaScript.

## Conditionals, Equality, and Comparisons in JS

Any programming language worth it's weight, has a way to handle control flow. JavaScript is no exception. Fortunately, the syntax of JavaScript makes this relatively easy to reason about for those new, unfortunately, there are some scenarios that we'll have to consider, that'll I'll make sure to point out.

### Equality Part 1

To assign a variable a value, we know by now that we use the `=` sign.

`const greeting = 'hello'`

To check for if two items are equal, we _can_ use two equal signs

`const isEqual = 3 == 3`

`console.log(isEqual) //true`

However, note that when using the double equal sign, the following situations arise:

If you ask JavaScript if `"3"` and `3` are the same thing, it'll say yesüò±

If you ask JavaScript if `0` and `false` are the same thing, it'll say yesüôÄ

If you ask JavaScript if `"1"` and `true` are the same thing, it'll say yesü§î

> üóíÔ∏è **This is because Javascript has a concept of _loose equality_ and _strict equality_**

Using the double equal sign opts us into _loose equality_ adding a third equal sign allows for _strict equality_.

Feel free to play around in the sandbox below to get a better idea.

https://codesandbox.io/s/javascript-equality-examples-l8xtn?file=/src/index.js

Because of this, it's considered best practice to use the triple equals `===` at all times, and not use the double `==` equals for equality checks.

In addition to checking if something is equal or not, JavaScript has the following operators that we'll be using through the course:

```md
| **Operator** | **Description**            |
| ------------ | -------------------------- |
| >            | Greater Than               |
| <            | Less Than                  |
| !            | Logical "not" !===         |
| >=           | Greater than or equal to   |
| <=           | Less than or equal to      |
| `||`         | Logical "or" 3`||` 7       |
| &&           | Logical "and" 2 && "hello" |
```

### Exploring Conditionals

In this course, we will explore three main types of conditionals. Each comes with their own set of use cases. They are the _if-statment_, _switch-case_ and the _ternary operator_. We'll explore the latter two as need be, but in this module, we take a glance at an if-statement.

**If-Statement**

```js
const name = 'Michael'

if(name=== "Michael") {
  console.log('Hello, Mr. Liendo')
}
// We can optionally add else-statements to our if-statements

const age = 31

if(age>= 31) {
  console.log('Wow..you're getting old.')
}else {
  console.log("You're still a child")
}
```

## üö®Project Timeüö®

Let's build a trivia game where the user has to guess the answer to 5 (easy) questions.

### Game Overview

- The game is played in the browser
- The user is asked their name via the `prompt()` function. Their name is stored for later use.
- Questions and answers are stored in variables (only basic types are used).
- The user's score is initially zero. If they get the the answer correct, the score increases.
- The user submits their answers via the `prompt()` function.
- At the end of each answer, the score will either increase or stay the same, and the next question will appear.
- Once the user has answered all of the questions, an `alert()` function will trigger, letting them know their score given in the following format:

- **0-2** "Oh wow {name}, you can do better."
- **3-4** "Keep practicing {name}, you got this!"
- **5** "Wow {name}, a perfect score!"
